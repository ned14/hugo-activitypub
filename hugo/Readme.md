Under the default settings:

1. Place the Hugo binary for your chosen Hugo here, or symlink it to here.
It must be called `hugo`.

2. Place the source for your Hugo website into a directory called `site`.
If you need a blank new website, do `hugo new site site` in this directory.

3. Ensure that your Hugo website outputs its HTML into the default directory
`../html` relative to the site sources. This is the default, ordinarily.

4. Make sure your Hugo website renders correctly using `hugo serve` and
testing what renders before running `hugo-activitypub`.
